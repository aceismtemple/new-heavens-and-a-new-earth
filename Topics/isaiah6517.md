### What does the verse means? does he mean a literal new heavens and a new earth like he will destroy the former or he will create a new chapter of within the old heaven and old earth?

## Isaiah 65:17 — “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth…”

When God speaks these words through Isaiah, He is giving Israel a vision of complete renewal — a future reality so transformed that the old sorrows, failures, and troubles will not even come to mind.

But what does “new heavens and new earth” mean in Isaiah’s context?

To answer that, we look at how the prophets spoke, what the surrounding verses describe, and how Israel would have understood the promise.

# 1. Does God mean a literal destruction of the present world?

In Isaiah, when God speaks of “new heavens and new earth,” He often uses cosmic language to describe massive renewal, not always literal annihilation.

Examples in the prophets:

* Isaiah 65 continues by describing things like long life, agriculture, families, peace, and no more violence (vv. 20–25) — things that still sound like life on earth, not after total destruction.

So in Isaiah’s immediate context, the phrase does not necessarily mean the physical universe ceases to exist. It often means:

### A completely renewed order of life

A new society.
A new moral order.
A new relationship between God and His people.
A world without the sins and wounds of the past.

# 2. Or does it mean a new chapter within the old creation?

This fits very naturally with Isaiah’s language.

The Hebrew word for “create” here — bara — means God is doing something foundational, something only He can do. But the prophets often describe:

* A renewed Jerusalem
* A restored land
* A renewed people
* Peace among nations
* A transformed environment (even animals living peacefully)

Yet all these transformations happen within the same world — not a replacement of earth, but a re-creation of life as they know it.

Isaiah 65 uses the same pattern:

### God is transforming the world so deeply

that the old troubles “shall not be remembered.”

That describes healing, restoration, and a new era, not necessarily the destruction of the physical cosmos.

---

# 3. The phrase “the former things shall not be remembered”

This is key.

God is not saying people lose their memories; He is saying the former pain, sin, sorrow, and judgment will no longer dominate the lives of His people.

The old order — filled with:

* rebellion
* exile
* injustice
* suffering
* disappointment

— will no longer define them.

This is the language of complete renewal of life, not just a new planet.

---

# 4. So what does Isaiah likely mean?

When we stay within Isaiah’s own book and his prophetic style, the message is:

## God is promising a renewed world, a renewed society, and a renewed people — so transformed that it is described as a “new heavens and new earth.”

This is poetic, prophetic language for:

* a new order of life
* a new era of God’s blessing
* a restoration so complete it feels like creation itself has begun again

It does not require a literal destruction of the universe in Isaiah’s immediate context.

It *does* require a total transformation of the world as Israel knows it.

---

# Summary

Isaiah 65:17 describes:

* Not necessarily a literal replacement of the physical world, but
* A total renewal — a re-creation — of life, peace, society, justice, and the people’s relationship with God, so profound that it is as if the world itself has been created anew.

The old world of sorrow and sin “passes away” not by destruction of the planet, but by God transforming His people’s lives and the conditions around them.

If you want, I can continue the sermon into verses 18–25, where the picture of the renewed world is described in detail.
