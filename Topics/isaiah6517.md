### What does the verse means? does he mean a literal new heavens and a new earth like he will destroy the former or he will create a new chapter of within the old heaven and old earth?

## **Isaiah 65:17 — “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth…”**

When God speaks these words through Isaiah, He is giving Israel a vision of complete renewal — a future reality so transformed that the old sorrows, failures, and troubles will not even come to mind.

But what does “new heavens and new earth” mean in Isaiah’s context?

To answer that, we look at how the prophets spoke, what the surrounding verses describe, and how Israel would have understood the promise.

---

# 1. Does God mean a literal destruction of the present world?

In Isaiah, when God speaks of “new heavens and new earth,” He often uses cosmic language to describe massive renewal, not always literal annihilation.

Examples in the prophets:

* Isaiah 65 continues by describing things like long life, agriculture, families, peace, and no more violence (vv. 20–25) — things that still sound **like life on earth**, not after total destruction.

So in Isaiah’s immediate context, the phrase does **not necessarily** mean the physical universe ceases to exist. It often means:

### **A completely renewed order of life**

A new society.
A new moral order.
A new relationship between God and His people.
A world without the sins and wounds of the past.

---

# **2. Or does it mean a new chapter within the old creation?**

This fits very naturally with Isaiah’s language.

The Hebrew word for “create” here — **bara** — means God is doing something **foundational**, something only He can do. But the prophets often describe:

* A **renewed Jerusalem**
* A **restored land**
* A **renewed people**
* Peace among nations
* A transformed environment (even animals living peacefully)

Yet all these transformations happen **within the same world** — not a replacement of earth, but a **re-creation of life as they know it**.

Isaiah 65 uses the same pattern:

### God is transforming the world so deeply

that the old troubles “shall not be remembered.”

That describes **healing**, **restoration**, and **a new era**, not necessarily the destruction of the physical cosmos.

---

# **3. The phrase “the former things shall not be remembered”**

This is key.

God is not saying people lose their memories; He is saying the **former pain, sin, sorrow, and judgment** will no longer dominate the lives of His people.

The old order — filled with:

* rebellion
* exile
* injustice
* suffering
* disappointment

— will no longer define them.

This is the language of **complete renewal of life**, not just a new planet.

---

# **4. So what does Isaiah likely mean?**

When we stay within Isaiah’s own book and his prophetic style, the message is:

## **God is promising a renewed world, a renewed society, and a renewed people — so transformed that it is described as a “new heavens and new earth.”**

This is **poetic, prophetic language** for:

* **a new order of life**
* **a new era of God’s blessing**
* **a restoration so complete it feels like creation itself has begun again**

It does **not** require a literal destruction of the universe in Isaiah’s immediate context.

It *does* require a total transformation of the world as Israel knows it.

---

# **Summary**

**Isaiah 65:17** describes:

* **Not necessarily a literal replacement of the physical world**, but
* **A total renewal — a re-creation — of life, peace, society, justice, and the people’s relationship with God**, so profound that it is as if the world itself has been created anew.

The old world of sorrow and sin “passes away” not by destruction of the planet, but by God transforming His people’s lives and the conditions around them.

# **Continuing — Isaiah 65:18–25**

**The shape of the “new heavens and new earth”**

After declaring that God will create “new heavens and a new earth,” Isaiah immediately begins to describe **what life in this renewed world looks like**. These details help us understand what God meant by *new*.

Let’s walk through the verses and unfold their meaning.

---

# **1. “Be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create” (v. 18)**

The first change in the new creation is **joy**.

Not a short joy.
Not a joy mixed with fear.
Not a joy that comes and goes.

But *lasting* joy.

In the present world Isaiah addresses, joy is fragile. Nations fall. People fail. Suffering interrupts celebration. But God says:

### “I create gladness itself.”

The renewal is not only physical or societal — it is **emotional and spiritual restoration**.

---

# **2. “No more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping” (v. 19)**

This does not mean a world where nothing difficult ever happens. It means a world where **sorrow does not rule**.

The kind of deep grief produced by oppression, injustice, exile, and loss is removed.

### God is promising a society where suffering no longer defines life.

Weeping may have been the background music of Israel’s life — but in God’s renewed world, it is no longer the dominant sound.

---

# **3. “No more shall there be… an infant who lives but a few days” (v. 20)**

This speaks to **physical stability and blessing**.

In ancient times, infant mortality was devastatingly common. The people understood this pain intimately.

God’s promise of long life and stability shows:

* **a transformed environment**
* **peaceful conditions**
* **health and safety**
* **the removal of curses and calamities**

This imagery shows God **reversing the conditions of judgment** and restoring the blessings of life.

---

# **4. People will “build houses and inhabit them,” “plant vineyards and eat their fruit” (vv. 21–22)**

In Isaiah’s time, this was not guaranteed.

Invaders could take your vineyard.
Armies could burn your home.
Foreigners could harvest what you planted.

This verse reverses that:

### Security replaces uncertainty.

### Stability replaces fear.

### Work becomes fruitful instead of fragile.

This is a symbol of **a renewed social order**, where people enjoy the results of their labor in peace.

---

# **5. “My chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands” (v. 22)**

Long enjoyment means:

* No sudden invasions
* No oppressive rulers
* No cycles of destruction
* No fear of loss

This is societal transformation. God is describing a world where **justice, peace, and order** endure.

---

# **6. “Before they call I will answer” (v. 24)**

This is the heart of the renewal:

### Restored relationship.

The people will no longer feel distant from God. No exile. No silence. No feeling abandoned.

God is close.
God is attentive.
God responds quickly.

This is the picture of a **healed relationship between God and His people** — personal, immediate, intimate.

---

# **7. “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together…” (v. 25)**

This is poetic language for **the end of hostility and violence**.

The wolf and lamb normally cannot coexist.
Predators do not lie peacefully beside prey.

But Isaiah describes a world where:

* natural enemies live in peace
* fear is gone
* danger is removed
* violence ends

This represents a world where the forces that once preyed on the weak — nations, systems, circumstances — are transformed or removed.

The world becomes safe.

---

# **So how does all this define “a new heavens and a new earth”?**

Based on the descriptions in Isaiah 65:17–25:

### **The “new heavens and new earth” is a renewed creation, renewed society, and renewed relationship with God — not necessarily a physically replaced planet.**

The renewal includes:

* **emotional healing** (no more weeping)
* **physical restoration** (long life, health)
* **social stability** (homes, vineyards, safety)
* **economic justice** (enjoying the work of their hands)
* **spiritual closeness** (God answers immediately)
* **the end of violence** (wolf and lamb imagery)

This is not about the destruction of the cosmos, but about the transformation of life.

God is creating **a new order**, not merely a new landscape.
