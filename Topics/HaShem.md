# What is the name of the Lord that we have to respect?

### 1. What YHWH Is

* **YHWH** (יהוה) is the **Tetragrammaton**, meaning “four letters” in Greek.
* It is considered the **personal, ineffable name of God** in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament).
* It appears over **6,800 times** in the Hebrew Scriptures.

---

### 2. Pronunciation

* Ancient Hebrew did not write vowels, so the exact pronunciation is **unknown**.

* The traditional Jewish practice is **not to pronounce it aloud**, out of reverence.

* Instead, Jews say:

  * **Adonai** (“Lord”) when reading scripture aloud.
  * **HaShem** (“The Name”) in everyday speech.

* Some scholars reconstruct a possible pronunciation as **Yahweh**, but this is academic and not used in traditional Jewish practice.

---

### 3. Meaning of the Name

* The name YHWH is linked to the Hebrew verb **“to be”** (*hayah*).
* In Exodus 3:14, HaShem says to Moses:

  > “I am who I am” (*Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh*)
* So YHWH conveys **existence itself, eternal being, and self-sufficiency**.
* It emphasizes that HaShem is **not dependent on anything** and is the source of all life.

---

### 4. Usage in Judaism

* **Written:** Appears in Torah scrolls, prayer books, and sacred texts.
* **Spoken:** Never pronounced as written; replaced with *Adonai* or *HaShem*.
* **Respect:** Writing “YHWH” outside of sacred contexts is often avoided.

---

### 5. Key Takeaways

* YHWH = the **unique, ineffable name of HaShem** in Jewish tradition.
* It signifies **HaShem’s eternal existence**.
* In practice, Jews **don’t say it aloud**, using *Adonai* or *HaShem* instead.

# Why we should refrain from using “Dios”?

Deus is the Latin word for "god" or "deity," stemming from the Proto-Indo-European root deiwos{/nav>}, meaning "shining" or "celestial being," which also gave rise to Greek Zeus, Sanskrit deva, and modern Romance words like Spanish Dios (God) and French Dieu (God). It refers generally to any god in Roman polytheism but became the singular term for the Christian God in Late Latin and religious texts, famously appearing in phrases like Deus vult ("God wills it") and deus ex machina ("god from a machine")

---

### 1. Historical Linguistic Background

* **Deus / Dios :**

  * *Deus* in Latin originally meant “god” in general—polytheistic usage.
  * *Dios* in Spanish inherited that meaning but, after Christianization, typically refers to the singular Christian God.
  * In English, “God” is unique to the monotheistic sense in modern usage, but etymologically it comes from older Germanic words meaning “deity” more generally.

* **Christian Redefinition:**
  Christianity largely co-opted these terms to mean the singular God of Abraham. So, using *Dios* today almost always invokes the Christian God culturally, even if the word historically meant any god.

* **Jewish Perspective:**
  In Jewish contexts, the focus is usually on *HaShem* (“the Name”) or *Elohim* (plural form used singularly for God), rather than “Dios” or “Deus.”

### 2. Using Tagalog

If you want to avoid Christian connotations, consider these options:

| Term                                      | Notes                                                                                                            | Suitability for Jewish context                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Diyos**                                 | Standard Tagalog for “God,” derived from Spanish *Dios*. Almost always perceived as Christian in modern context. | May carry Christian associations; not ideal if you want strictly Jewish usage.          |
| **Makapangyarihan sa lahat** (“Almighty”) | Descriptive rather than nominal; avoids the Spanish origin.                                                      | Neutral, emphasizes monotheistic power.                                                 |
| **Elohim**                                | Hebrew term, often used in Jewish liturgy.                                                                       | Fully aligned with Jewish tradition; recognizable if audience understands Hebrew terms. |
| **YHWH / HaShem**                         | Hebrew name of God; *HaShem* means “the Name” when avoiding pronouncing YHWH.                                    | Most traditionally Jewish; highly respectful.                                           |
| **Panginoon** (“Lord”)                    | More generic than *Diyos*, sometimes used in prayers.                                                            | Could work, but still Christian-tinged in popular use.                                  |

# How about the english word “God”?
### 1. Etymology of “God”

* The English word **“God”** comes from **Old English** *god* (c. 8th century).
* Proto-Germanic root: ***gudan** – meaning “that which is invoked” or simply “deity.”
* This ultimately comes from **Proto-Indo-European** root ***ǵhu-tó-**, meaning “that which is invoked, worshiped” (from verb root **ǵhau-* “to call, to invoke”).

**Key points:**

* Originally, *god* didn’t refer exclusively to the monotheistic God; it was a general word for any deity.
* In Old English paganism, *god* could mean one of many gods.
* With Christianization of England, *God* came to refer specifically to the singular God of Christianity—but the word itself is linguistically neutral.

### 2. Comparison to “Dios/Deus”

| Aspect               | God (English)                                            | Deus / Dios (Latin/Spanish)                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Original meaning     | Any deity (polytheistic usage)                           | Any deity (polytheistic usage)                |
| Modern usage         | Singular, monotheistic in most contexts                  | Usually singular Christian God today          |
| Linguistic origin    | Germanic/Indo-European                                   | Latin/Italic                                  |
| Cultural association | Monotheistic but less directly “Christian” in casual use | Strong Christian connotation in Spanish today |


---

### 3. Jewish Usage in English

* Jewish texts often use **God** in English translations of the Torah/Bible.
* Some prefer **HaShem** (“the Name”) in speech to avoid casual use of “God,” especially in prayer.



### ✅ Recommendation

* **For clarity in a Jewish context in Tagalog:**
  Use **Elohim** or **HaShem** if addressing The God of Israel directly in prayer or discussion.
  For descriptive references (*“Almighty”* or *“God of Israel”*), **Makapangyarihan sa lahat** or **Diyos ng Israel** works without fully Christianizing the term.

* **Avoid using plain *Diyos*** if you want to clearly distance from Christian connotations, because culturally it almost always points to the Christian God today.
