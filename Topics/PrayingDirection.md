**Jews traditionally pray facing toward the Land of Israel**, and more specifically toward **Jerusalem**, and even more specifically toward the **Temple Mount** (Har HaBayit), which is considered the holiest place in Judaism.

Here is how it works:

### **➡️ If a Jew is outside Israel**

They pray **toward Israel** → **toward Jerusalem** → **toward the Temple Mount**.

For example:

* In the **Philippines**: generally westward.
* In **Europe**: generally southeast.
* In **North America**: generally east or northeast.
* In **Japan**: generally west.

### **➡️ If a Jew is inside Israel**

They pray **toward Jerusalem**.

### **➡️ If inside Jerusalem**

They pray **toward the Temple Mount**.

### Why?

This practice comes from:

* **1 Kings 8:44–48**, where Solomon prays that HaShem will hear the prayers of the people “when they pray toward this place.”
* **Talmud, Berakhot 30a**, which instructs that one should direct their heart and body toward the Temple.

### Practical custom

Most synagogues around the world build their **ark (Aron Kodesh)**—where Torah scrolls are kept—facing Jerusalem so that everyone prays in the correct direction.
