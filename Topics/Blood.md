# Can we eat blood?

The Old Testament gives **several reasons** why blood must not be eaten. This rule appears many times (Genesis, Leviticus, Deuteronomy), and the explanations fall into **spiritual, symbolic, and ethical** meanings.

## **1. Because “the life is in the blood”**

This is the clearest Biblical reason.

> — *Leviticus 17:11-12*

> **“11 For the life of the flesh is in its blood; and I have given it to you on the altar to take away your sin: for it is the blood which makes free from sin because of the life in it.”**

> **"12 For this reason I have said to the children of Israel, No man among you, or any others living with you, may take blood as food."**


To ancient Israel, blood represented *life itself*, something sacred belonging to HaShem. Eating it was seen as disrespecting the life HaShem created.

## **2. Blood belonged to HaShem for atonement**

The same verse says blood was given to make atonement for sins:

> “I have given it to you… to make atonement.”
> — *Leviticus 17:11*

Meaning:

* only HaShem could decide how blood was used,
* its proper use was **on the altar**, not as food.

So eating blood was like misusing what HaShem set aside for forgiveness.

## **3. To separate Israel from pagan practices**

Many ancient nations drank blood in rituals, believing it gave power or union with gods or spirits.

HaShem told Israel to avoid this because:

* it was tied to idolatry,
* it made Israel **distinct** and holy.

(See Leviticus 17:7)

## **4. Respect for life and humane treatment of animals**

Even in Genesis (before the Law of Moses), HaShem said:

> “You must not eat the blood, for the life is in the blood.”
> — *Genesis 9:4*

This came right after Noah left the ark — before Israel even existed.

So it was a **universal rule**, reminding people to:

* value life,
* not be cruel or animalistic,
* recognize that life belongs to HaShem.

# How Jews observe it (kosher meat draining)

## **1. Blood Must Be Drained**

Kosher laws ensure that meat is **blood-free** before it is eaten:

* **Shechita**: Ritual slaughter that drains blood carefully.
* **Salting and soaking**: Meat is salted and soaked to remove residual blood.

Even small amounts of blood are considered a violation.


## **In summary:**

* **It represents life**, which belongs to HaShem
* **It was reserved for sacred use** (atonement)
* **It separated Israel from pagan rituals**
* **It instilled respect for life**
* **Blood must be drained**
