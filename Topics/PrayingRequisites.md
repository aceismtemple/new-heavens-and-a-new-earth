### Praying Like Elijah — A Heart Made Right

In **1 Kings 17:1**, Elijah declares to King Ahab that **there will be no rain** except at his word:

  > “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.”


Elijah stood before King Ahab not with earthly authority but with spiritual authority. His confidence came from being a man who walked in obedience to the Lord. Elijah could speak this way because he stood before God—his life was aligned with God’s will. God listens to those who honor Him.


For us to pray properly—like Elijah—we must first **set things right in our hearts and relationships**. Elijah was bold before HaShem because his heart was aligned with HaShem's will.

Before we lift our prayers, we must **fix our wrongdoings toward others**.
We cannot hold bitterness, pride, or unconfessed sin and expect heaven to listen.

The Psalmist shows this truth:

> **“I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid:
> I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord;
> and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.”**
> — *Psalm 32:5*

Here we learn that **confession opens the way for forgiveness**.
When we hide sin, our prayers are hindered—but when we confess, HaShem restores.

The Old Testament reinforces this principle:

> **“He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
> but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”**
> — *Proverbs 28:13*

So, before we pray like Elijah, we must:

1. **Acknowledge our wrong.**
2. **Ask forgiveness—from HaShem and from the people we have hurt.**
3. **Forsake the sin—stop repeating it.**

Even Isaiah speaks of how sin affects prayer:

> **“But your iniquities have separated between you and your HaShem,
> and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”**
> — *Isaiah 59:2*

If sin separates, then **repentance reconnects**.

Elijah was heard by HaShem not because he was perfect, but because he walked in **obedience and alignment**. When he prayed on Mount Carmel, we see his heart:

> **“I have done all these things at thy word.”**
> — *1 Kings 18:36*

He had no hidden rebellion. He acted according to HaShem's instruction—
and therefore his prayer carried power.

### **Application**

If we want HaShem to hear our prayers:

* **Repair relationships.**
  “Seek peace, and pursue it” (Psalm 34:14)

* **Confess what we have done wrong.**
  “Wash you, make you clean” (Isaiah 1:16)

* **Return to HaShem sincerely.**
  “Turn ye even to me with all your heart” (Joel 2:12)

Then, like Elijah, we can stand before HaShem **with confidence**, because our hearts are clean and our relationships restored.
